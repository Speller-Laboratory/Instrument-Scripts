Title: Rigol Oscilloscope DS1054Z Waveform Tracing
This script is intended to capture the data of the waveform produced on the Rigol Osilloscope DS1054Z. This includes setting parameters of the oscilloscope, accumulating the data, and converting the measurements into a csv file.For a greater explanation of this script, see the readME file associated with the Rigol Oscilloscope scripts.
